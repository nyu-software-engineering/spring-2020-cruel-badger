Broke Millennial

Product Vision Statement
Broke Millennial is an application that allows young people to financially plan for the future as they transition to a new stage of their lives, especially those who are going through a transition, such as graduating college or moving to a new city. 

In our Minimum Viable Product, we want to be able to be able to input financial data, and generate meaningful results for the present and future. Our working prototype is functional on a computer.

History
This project came to be as we, a group of seniors at NYU, began planning for our future after graduation. The real world comes with real responsibilities, and we wanted to come up with a a solution to ease that transition.
