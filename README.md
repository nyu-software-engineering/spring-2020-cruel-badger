# __README: Broke Millennial__ 

## __Product Vision Statement:__
Broke Millennial is an application that allows young people to financially plan for the future as they transition to a new stage of their lives, such as graduating college or moving to a new city. 

In our Minimum Viable Product, we want to be able to input financial data and generate meaningful results for a given future path. Our working prototype is functional on a computer.

## __History:__
This project came to be as we, a group of seniors at NYU, began planning for our futures after graduation. The real world comes with real responsibilities, and we wanted to come up with a a solution to ease that transition.
