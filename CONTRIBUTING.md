## __Project's Values:__ 
As a financial planning/budgeting app designed for young people in transitional life periods such as moves, job changes, vacation planning, car buying etc, we value simplicity, accuracy, and user-benefit.

## __Team Norms:__ 

### -- Definition of Done -- 
A task is 'done' when it has been completed to the fullest extent, does not require any revisions, and has been seen and approved by other team members.

### -- Working Together and Conflict Resolution -- 
We, as contributers and developers on this project, agree to use welcoming, understanding, and respectful language and actions towards each other. We agree to take constructive criticism well and put the well-being of the project first above personal preference. When conflict/disagreement should arise, we agree to discuss that conflict until everyone is heard and come to a vote or majority agreement on how to move forward. Any kind of harrassment or unacceptable behavior will be reported to the teacher, including not completing individual responsibilities/tasks assigned to them. 

### -- Sprint Cadence -- 
Sprints should take only a few weeks and should follow the class schedule

### -- Standups Schedule -- 
The tentative standup schedule is Tuesdays and Thursdays at 2:00pm, and Sundays at approx 12:00pm. 

### -- Responding to Messages --
Team members should respond to messages directed at them within 24 hours.

### -- Rules for Prioritizing the Backlog -- 
The more valuable the outcome of the story, the higher it is in the backlog. The Product Backlog is managed by the Product Owner, but with Developer involvement and feedback. In each sprint the team tries to complete stories from the top of the Backlog, although stories from further down the backlog may be added to a sprint to come up with a level of effort that is achievable.
